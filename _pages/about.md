👨🏻‍💻 I am currently a Software Engineer at D-Shape 


🔬 My research interests are in Robotics Design and Human Centred Design. 


📚 I’m a graduate from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with my thesis focussing "On the Planning of Handling Large Arbitrarily Curved Glass Sheets"  

📽️ I am also interested in software development for the robotic / additive manufacturing applications. 


<h1>📜 Thesis Projects</h1>

<h2>On the Planning of Handling Large Arbitrarily Curved Glass Sheets</h2>
<h3>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST)|| MPhil Thesis</h3>
Deeets of the work I did 


<h2>Development of Self-navigation system for Segway LOOMO for Property Management</h2>
<h3>The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST) || MSc Thesis</h3>
At Cheng Kar-Shun Robotics Institute ([CKSRI(https://ri.hkust.edu.hk/)]) at HKUST, I worked on implementing SLAM on the Android-based Segway Loomo platform using ROS integration and LiDAR, as well as developing an Android application to enable efficient property management through seamless integration with the robot’s navigation system. 



<h2>Design of an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV)</h2>
<h3>Indian Institute of Information Technology Jabalpur || Bachelors Thesis</h3>
As a Visiting Student at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/indian-institute-technology-delhi-iitd), I worked on designing and modifying the chassis and belt-driven transmission system of an all-terrain vehicle for disaster management, focusing on weight reduction, enhanced maneuverability, and increased payload capacity.




<h1>👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience</h1>

I am currently a Software Engineer at [D-Shape](https://d-shape.com) where I am working on the **Software Development** for the Robotic Large Format Additive Manufacturing (LFAM) 3D Printer Applications.

Previously I have worked as an **Industrial Engineer** at [Precision Microdrives Ltd., Hong Kong](https://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/) specializing in mechanical design and software development. I design jigs and fixtures using CAD, FEA, and GD&T, optimize designs with DFMEA principles, and enhance production efficiency through prototyping. Additionally, I develop Arduino-based testing systems and user-friendly Python interfaces for streamlined operations.
