👨🏻‍💻 I am currently a Software Engineer at D-Shape 


🔬 My research interests are in Robotics Design and Human Centred Design. 


📚 I’m a graduate from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with my thesis focussing "On the Planning of Handling Large Arbitrarily Curved Glass Sheets"  

📽️ I am also interested in software development for the robotic / additive manufacturing applications. 



<h1>!👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience</h1>

I am currently a Software Engineer at [D-Shape](https://d-shape.com) where I am working on the **Software Development** for the** Robotic Large Format Additive Manufacturing (LFAM) 3D Printer Applications** 

Previously I have worked as an **Industrial Engineer** at [Precision Microdrives Ltd., Hong Kong](https://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/) specializing in mechanical design and software development. I design jigs and fixtures using CAD, FEA, and GD&T, optimize designs with DFMEA principles, and enhance production efficiency through prototyping. Additionally, I develop Arduino-based testing systems and user-friendly Python interfaces for streamlined operations.
