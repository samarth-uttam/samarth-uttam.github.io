👨🏻‍💻 I am currently a Software Engineer at D-Shape 


🔬 My research interests are in Human Centred Robotic Design. 


📚 I’m a graduate from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with my thesis focussing "On the Planning of Handling Large Arbitrarily Curved Glass Sheets"  

📽️ I am also interested in software development for the robotic / additive manufacturing applications.

<h3 style="margin-top: 0;color: grey; font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"> MPhil Thesis at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST)</h3>

During my MPhil thesis, my research focused on the planning and handling of large arbitrarily curved glass sheets using advanced computational design and optimization techniques. I utilized Finite Element Methods to analyze stress and developed optimization algorithms, including adaptive k-means and heuristic methods, to enhance lifting efficiency and reduce stress. My work also involved researching industrial techniques and applying Python-based modifications to improve algorithm performance and runtime.

As a Visiting Student at [Indian Institute of Technology Delhi](https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/indian-institute-technology-delhi-iitd), I worked on designing and modifying the chassis and belt-driven transmission system of an all-terrain vehicle for disaster management, focusing on weight reduction, enhanced maneuverability, and increased payload capacity.




<h1>👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience</h1>

I am currently a Software Engineer at [D-Shape](https://d-shape.com) where I am working on the **Software Development** for the Robotic Large Format Additive Manufacturing (LFAM) 3D Printer Applications.

Previously I have worked as an **Industrial Engineer** at [Precision Microdrives Ltd., Hong Kong](https://www.precisionmicrodrives.com/) specializing in mechanical design and software development. I design jigs and fixtures using CAD, FEA, and GD&T, optimize designs with DFMEA principles, and enhance production efficiency through prototyping. Additionally, I develop Arduino-based testing systems and user-friendly Python interfaces for streamlined operations.
